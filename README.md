# ðŸŽ¥ðŸŽ¥ Six Degrees Of Kevin Bacon: A Movie Trivia App ðŸŽ¥ðŸŽ¥

Ever hear of the expression [six degrees of separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation)? That's a concept that theorizes that any two people in the world are connected by six or fewer acquaintances. [Six Degrees Of Kevin Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon) is a parlour game based on that expression, and this movie trivia app is loosely based on that parlour game.

In this app, you are presented with a list of randomly selected movies, one of which is a movie that Kevin Bacon acted in. Your challenge is simple: pick the movie that Kevin Bacon acted in.

The app also recognizes that, hey, maybe you're not a Kevin Bacon fan. So as an extra twist of fun and flexibility, the app allows you to submit your own actor/actress of choice and see if you can pick out the movie that your chosen actor/actress was in from a list of randomly selected movies.

This was a side project done mostly in a day but fine-tuned on the front end over a second day while at [Fullstack Academy](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/) in Chicago.
